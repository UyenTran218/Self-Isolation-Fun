# Self Isolation Fun - C#.NET - Javascript
---
### This project explores some of the different methods to incorporate dynamic content into a dynamic website that focuses on 14 Fun Things to do whilst self-isolating at home!  
---
3 different pages advertising these fun things to do using the following 3 different approaches: 
1.	Traditional declarative Web Forms (using Drag and Drop and server data controls)
2.	Model bound Web Forms (using LINQ/Lambda)
3.	Model View Controller

The pages are styled using bootstrap, mood brightening colours and motivational hues were used to ensure the website looks bright and cheerful during these isolating times
